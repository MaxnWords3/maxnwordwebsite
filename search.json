Not those who lose the fight!\nThe second Kahn’s reign ends, burnt out in the sunlight!\nAfter Shao was killed, you integrated Asian into Aztec, yet your authority’s not respected.\nYour turned tail or betrayed you, how the hell did you not detect it?!\nThis blue fish must be out of water, ’cause power is over his head.\nHey, K’uk’ulkan! You should grab him before this fish winds up dead!\nKotal Kahn\nFor all the mythologies, this Sun God spits least fire.\nHe’s fly like a hummingbird when he’s about to retire.\nWhat a little bird can do against the Black Jaguar of Mortal Kombat?\nNo matter how poorly written I was, you’re the God that falls flat.\nHow weak am I when you’re the only War God who’s always on the run?\nYou were like that when you beheaded your sister then her children for fun.\nYou have worse sibling issues when you fight like Tom and Jerry.\nHuītzilōpōchtli\nIrrelevant, mortal?! You underestimate the mythologies you read.\n“You can’t win a duel against Shao without losing your head.\nYou stole Shao’s crown, but challenging me’s your fatal mistake.\nNow your heart and your head?

It’s official. YOU SUCK!!!\nKotal Kahn\nWith all the"
